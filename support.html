    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    
    <h4>How does MyVibe analyze my aesthetic style?</h4>
    <p>MyVibe uses Apple's Vision Framework and Core ML to analyze key features from your photos. The app analyzes body structure, proportions, colors, and other aesthetic elements to determine your unique aesthetic profile and provide personalized style recommendations.</p>
    
    <h4>Are my photos stored or shared?</h4>
    <p>No. All photo processing happens locally on your device. We do not store, upload, or share your photos with any servers or third parties. Your photos remain private and secure on your device.</p>
    
    <h4>How accurate are the analysis results?</h4>
    <p>The analysis is based on algorithmic calculations and machine learning models that analyze body proportions, colors, and aesthetic features. For best results, use clear, well-lit photos. Results are provided for informational and entertainment purposes and should not be considered as professional styling advice.</p>
    
    <h4>Can I use photos from my gallery?</h4>
    <p>Yes! You can either take a new photo with the camera or select an existing photo from your photo library. The app requires permission to access your camera and photo library to provide these features.</p>
    
    <h4>What is the premium subscription?</h4>
    <p>The premium subscription provides access to additional features and enhanced functionality. Premium features may include advanced analysis options, wardrobe organization tools, and exclusive aesthetic profiles. Subscription details and pricing are available in the app.</p>
    
    <h4>How do I cancel my premium subscription?</h4>
    <p>You can cancel your premium subscription at any time through your Apple ID settings:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Settings on your iPhone or iPad</li>
        <li>Tap on your Apple ID at the top</li>
        <li>Tap "Subscriptions"</li>
        <li>Find MyVibe and tap "Cancel Subscription"</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>How does the wardrobe feature work?</h4>
    <p>The wardrobe feature allows you to organize your clothing items by category, color, and style. You can add photos of your clothing items and the app will help you organize and categorize them for easy reference.</p>
    
    <h4>What data does the app collect?</h4>
    <p>MyVibe processes your photos locally on your device to provide analysis. We do not upload or store your photos on our servers. We may collect anonymous usage statistics to improve the app. For more details, please see our Privacy Policy.</p>
    
    <h4>Can I use the app offline?</h4>
    <p>Yes! Most features of MyVibe work offline since all analysis is performed on your device. However, some features like subscription management and app updates require an internet connection.</p>
    
    <h4>How do I clear my analysis history?</h4>
    <p>You can clear your analysis history and app data through the app settings or by deleting and reinstalling the app. Note that clearing app data will remove all saved analysis results and preferences.</p>
